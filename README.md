# Creation-Of-My-Engineering-Repository
Repository for my design-build engineering project.

This is a copy of my original integration code for the facial recognition hardware with built in software. 

The main idea is that when the software detects a face, it is supposed to send an output to my USB port. 

From there, Arduino IDE will be "watching" my USB port for it's input. 

When it receives the USB input, it is supposed to send a "high" signal to my Arduino UNO board. 

From there the high signal will turn the piezo on.

At least, that's how it's supposed to work in theory.

In reality, I am a complete buffoon who has no idea what he's doing.

I can't get it to work, and I can't find any tutorials that are even anywhere near close to what I need.
